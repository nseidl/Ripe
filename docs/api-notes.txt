Metadata Store

Endpoints:
- /media/videos/<unique_id>.json
  - use md5 in order to generate unique_id so that we don't ever store duplicate media
  - pure text file that we can json.read(...) from (so use json.dump(...) to create it)

Video:
<unique_video_id>.json: {
	uploaded_by: <user unique_id>,
	date_uploaded: see below, 
	file_size: (KB),
	duration: (seconds),
	file_location: http://blobstore.domain...,
	exposed_users: see below,
	location: (GPS location),
	ripe: (true/false),
	ripe_score: #,
}
  - date_uploaded
    - seconds since epoch, so we can do useful calculations easily without parsing formatted time
    {	since_epoch: ...,
    	formatted: ... }
  - exposed_user:
    - keep one singular spot of information linking users to video to reduce data synchronization issues
    - having this data so deep inside json might make finding it take a while
    {	<user unique_id>: { time_to_action: ...,
    						time_exposed: ...,
    						result: (liked | disliked | reported) }, 
   	}

User:
<unique_user_id>.json: {		
	date_created: ,
	email_address: ,
	username: ,
	encrypted_password: , 
	name: ,
	DOB: ,
	gender: ,
	videos: <ids>,
	location: ,
	current_peaches: <ids>,
	all_peaches: <ids>,
}

Desired endpoints:
- GET a list of all videos that a user has (liked | disliked | seen)
- GET a list of all users that a video has been (shown to | liked by | seen)
- GET a list of the current top n videos
